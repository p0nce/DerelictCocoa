DerelictCocoa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/p0nce/DerelictCocoa.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/p0nce/DerelictCocoa)
=============

*Warning: this a VERY bare-bones unofficial Derelict binding.*

A dynamic binding to [Cocoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)) for the D Programming Language. **This binding is incomplete. Use PR to add more stuff.**

Please see the pages [Building and Linking Derelict](http://derelictorg.github.io/compiling.html) and [Using Derelict](http://derelictorg.github.io/using.html), or information on how to build DerelictCocoa and load the Cocoa library at run time. In the meantime, here's some sample code: http://github.com/p0nce/DerelictCocoa/blob/master/examples/window/window.d
